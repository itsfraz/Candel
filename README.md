## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the candle and animations.
- **CSS3**: Styling and animations for the flame, particles, and wax.
- **JavaScript**: Dynamic generation of particles and sparkles.

## 🎥 How It Works

The candle animation is created using a combination of CSS keyframes and JavaScript. The flame flickers using `@keyframes`, while the particles and sparkles are dynamically generated using JavaScript.

### Key Components:
- **Flame**: The flame is animated using `transform` and `box-shadow` properties to create a flickering effect.
- **Particles**: Floating particles are generated randomly and animated to move across the screen.
- **Melting Wax**: The wax melting effect is achieved using CSS animations and gradients.
